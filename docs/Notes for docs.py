### Oblique orbits
# Prograde orbit
# - Eastward (from west to east)
# - In the same direction as the earth rotation
# - Inclination < 90°
# - Regress with respect to the planes of their initial orbit
# - Example: GEOs, TRMM, GPM

# Retrograde orbit
# - Westward (from east to west)
# - In the opposite direction of the earth rotation
# - Precess with respect to the planes of their initial orbit
# - Inclination > 90°
# - Example:
#   - sun syncronous orbits: A-Train
#   - MetOP-A, B, NOAA ...
