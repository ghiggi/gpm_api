GPM Mission
---------------

The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, an international collaborative effort between NASA, JAXA, and other space agencies,
was initiated following the success of the :ref:`Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite <trmm_satellite>` launched in November 1997.

The GPM mission aims to acquire accurate and frequent global observations of Earth's precipitation.
The mission relies on the TRMM, the :ref:`GPM Core Observatory (GPM-CO) satellite <gpm_core_satellite>` and a constellation of satellites equipped
with microwave radiometers which forms the so-called :ref:`GPM Constellation <gpm_constellation>`.

The reference sensors for the GPM mission are the:

- :ref:`TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR) <trmm_pr>`
- :ref:`TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) <trmm_tmi>`
- :ref:`GPM Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) <gpm_dpr>`
- :ref:`GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) <gpm_gmi>`

The :ref:`GPM Data Archive <gpm_data_archive>` currently includes satellite data records that extend back to 1987.
This extensive archive is the result of contributions from two spaceborne radars and a fleet of 26 passive microwave (PMW) sensors that forms the so-called GPM constellation.

The data are organized into various :ref:` product levels <gpm_product_levels>`,
encompassing raw and calibrated observations (Level 1), intermediate geophysical retrieval products (Level 2),
and spatio-temporally integrated datasets from single and multiple satellites (Level 3).

While the GPM mission is renowned for providing a long-term data records of precipitation, its satellite data have also been essential for the quantification,
monitoring and understanding of a broad spectrum of atmospheric, ocean and terrestrial surface processes.
Examples include monitoring sea-ice concentration and snow-cover extent, estimating ocean wind speeds and sea surface temperatures,
and profiling atmospheric humidity and temperature.
Moreover, GPM data have also been crucial for identifying global hotspots for hail and intense thunderstorms, analyzing storm structures
and examining the latent heat release that drives the atmospheric circulation.


.. _trmm_satellite:

TRMM satellite
---------------

The `Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite <https://gpm.nasa.gov/missions/trmm>`_,
launched in November 1997 as a collaborative effort between the
United States' National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the
Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA),
marked a significant milestone for the satellite remote sensing observation of tropical precipitations between 37°N/S.
Its primary objective was to accurately measure rainfall associated with tropical convective activity, which play a crucial role in the global dynamics of the atmospheric circulation.

Equipped with pioneering technology including the first spaceborne
:ref:`Precipitation Radar (PR) <trmm_pr>`,
the :ref:`TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) <trmm_tmi>`,
the `Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS) imager <https://gpm.nasa.gov/missions/TRMM/satellite/virs>`_,
and the `Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) <https://ghrc.nsstc.nasa.gov/lightning/overview_lis_instrument.html>`_,
TRMM aimed to revolutionize rainfall observation.

Operating in a non-sun-synchronous orbit at a 35° inclination, the TRMM satellite has been strategically positioned
to sample the diurnal cycle of precipitation over a wide geographic area, a capability not shared by most of the
:ref:`GPM constellation <gpm_constellation>` polar-orbiting sensors which typically acquire observations at fixed local times.

Moreover, this orbit enables to obtain coincident measurements with other PMW sensors within the GPM Constellation.
Consequently, this allows for the use of the TMI as a common radiometric reference standard for intersensor calibration
across the full range of microwave frequencies present in the GPM Constellation of microwave radiometers during the TRMM era.
This calibration process improves the consistency and quality of derived precipitation estimates.

The combined use of PR and TMI significantly enhanced rainfall estimation accuracy over the tropics and subtropics.
Moreover, PR provided unprecedented insights into the three-dimensional structure of cyclones over the ocean,
as well as rainfall characteristics of the Madden-Julian Oscillation and other climate phenomena such as El Niño and La Niña.

The success of the TRMM mission underscored the potential of satellite remote sensing in advancing our understanding of Earth's water cycle
and improving weather forecasting capabilities.

.. _trmm_pr:

TRMM PR
~~~~~~~~

The TRMM `Precipitation Radar (PR) <https://gpm.nasa.gov/missions/TRMM/satellite/PR>`_ is a Ku-band (13.6 GHz) cross-track scanning radar with a swath coverage of 215 km.
The PR accurately quantifies heavier rainfall in the tropics and the subtropics, but lacks of sensitivity to detect light precipitation and drizzle.

If you plan to use PR measurements, it's essential to consider the satellite orbit boost (from 350 km to 402.5 km) occurred in August 2011 to extend the satellite lifetime.
Following the boost, the swath coverage has widened to 220 km but the spatial resolution of PR footprints has increased from 4.3 km to 5 km
and the PR sensitivity has reduced by more than 1 dBZ.

Please note that PR routine operations has ended on October 7th, 2014, although PR data are still available till January 15th, 2015
while TRMM descended to the decommissioning altitude of 335 km.


.. _trmm_tmi:

TRMM TMI
~~~~~~~~

The `TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) <https://gpm.nasa.gov/missions/TRMM/satellite/TMI>`_ is a passive microwave, dual-polarization conically scanning radiometer equipped with 9 channels.
ranging from 10.7 GHz to 85.5 GHz (the 21.3 GHz has only single polarization).
The TMI has a swath coverage of 760 km and a spatial resolution ranging between 5 and 37 km at 85.5 and 10.65 GHz respectively.

Build upon the highly successful Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) sensors onboard of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites, TMI has
an additional 10.7 GHz channel and an improved spatial resolution (due to the lower flying altitude).

If you plan to use TMI measurements, it's essential to consider the satellite orbit boost (from 350 km to 402.5 km) occurred in August 2011 to extend the satellite lifetime.
Following the boost, the swath coverage has widened and the instantanoues field of view of each channel has enlarged.


.. _gpm_core_satellite:

GPM Core Observatory
---------------------

The `GPM Core Observatory (GPM-CO) satellite <https://gpm.nasa.gov/missions/GPM/core-observatory>`_,
a joint collaboration between NASA and JAXA, was launched on February 28, 2014,
building upon the legacy of the TRMM to extend precipitation measurement capabilities from the tropics to higher latitudes (68°N/S).

Equipped with advanced instruments such as the :ref:`Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) <gpm_dpr>` and the
:ref:`GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) <gpm_gmi>`, the GPM Core Observatory can accurately measure a wide range of precipitation types,
from light rain and snowfall to heavy tropical rainstorm.

Operating in a non-sun-synchronous orbit at a 65° inclination, the GPM Core Observatory is strategically positioned like :ref:`TRMM <trmm_satellite>`
to sample the diurnal cycle of precipitation over a wide geographic area, a capability not shared by most of the
:ref:`GPM constellation <gpm_constellation>` polar-orbiting sensors which typically acquire observations at fixed local times.

Moreover, this orbit enables to obtain coincident measurements with other PMW sensors within the GPM Constellation.
Consequently, this allows for the use of the GMI as a common radiometric reference standard for intersensor calibration
across the full range of microwave frequencies present in the GPM Constellation of microwave radiometers.
This calibration process improves the consistency and quality of derived precipitation estimates.

The video here below provides an nice overview of the GPM Core Observatory satellite.

.. _gpm_dpr:

GPM DPR
~~~~~~~~

The `GPM Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) <https://gpm.nasa.gov/missions/GPM/DPR>`_ features a Ka-band precipitation radar (KaPR)
operating at 35.5 GHz and a Ku-band precipitation radar (KuPR) at 13.6 GHz.

While the KaPR instrument has been designed to detect weak rainfall and snowfall beyond the KuPR's sensitivity,
the KuPR excels at quantifying heavier rainfall and extends the long-term record of TRMM PR in the tropics and the subtropics.

Together, KaPR and KuPR enable three-dimensional dual-frequency observations of precipitation structures and accurate measurement across precipitation types.
This capability spans from heavy rainfall in the tropics to weak rainfall in mid-to-high latitudes and snowfall in high-latitudes.

.. figure:: https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/GPM/image/overview-dpr.png
  :alt: GPM DPR Overview
  :align: center

  GPM DPR Overview

Note, however, that despite its detailed insights into precipitation structure and dynamics,
the DPR exhibits low sensitivity to light precipitation and drizzle, resulting in significant portions of the lightest precipitation going undetected.

Nonetheless, its detection capabilities miss only a small fraction of the total rain volume due to the relatively minor contribution from light rain and snowfall.
Comparisons with CloudSat measurements revealed that DPR does not detect more than 90% of the snowfall identified by CloudSat and tends to underestimate surface snowfall accumulation.
It is worth noting, however, that recent studies have shown advances in reducing surface clutter contamination and improving receiver noise-reducing algorithms, which have led to improved detection of light precipitation.

If you plan to analyze or use DPR measurements, it's essential to consider that the scan pattern of KaPR changed on May 21, 2018.

Prior to the scan pattern change, the dual-frequency information was only available within a narrow inner swath of 125 km.
However, after the pattern change, dual-frequency observations are available across the full swath of approximately 245 km.

The figure and video here below illustrate the scan pattern change.

Please also note that the GPM-CO satellite underwent an orbit boost (from 407 km to 442 km) the 7/8 November 2023 to extend the satellite lifetime.
Following the boost, the swath coverage has widened to 268 km but the spatial resolution of DPR footprints has increased from 5 km to 5.48 km
and the DPR sensitivity has reduced by approximately 0.8-0.9 dBZ.


.. _gpm_gmi:

GPM GMI
~~~~~~~~

The `GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) <https://gpm.nasa.gov/missions/GPM/GMI>`_ is a dual-polarization, multi-channel, conical- scanning, microwave radiometer
equipped with 13 channels ranging from 10 GHz to 183 GHz.

Compared to the TMI instrument on TRMM, the GMI has an improved spatial resolution and carries 4 additional high-frequency channels near 166 GHz and 183 GHz.

Each channel is sensitive to a different frequency of microwave energy naturally emitted from or affected by precipitation.
Lower frequency channels are sensitive to heavy and moderate rainfall, while the high-frequency channels are affected by water vapor and ice particles.

A visual overview of the GMI channels is provided in the figure below:

.. figure:: https://gpm.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/2019-11/GMI-13-channels.jpg
  :alt: GPM GMI channels
  :align: center

  Overview of the GPM GMI channels

It's important to note that the channel footprint size decreases with increasing frequency,
and the high-frequency channels are not aligned with the low-frequency channels.

However, the  ``1C-GMI-R`` product addresses this issue providing the low-frequency channels collocated with the nearest neighbor high-frequency channels.

Furthermore, it's worth noting that only the central portion of the GMI swath overlaps the radar swath, with a delay of approximately 67 seconds caused by
the spacecraft motion and geometric considerations.

When using GMI measurements, it's essential to consider the satellite orbit boost (from 407 km to 442 km) occurred the 7/8 November 2023 to extend the satellite lifetime.
Following the boost, the swath coverage has widened and the instantaneous field of view of each channel has enlarged.

Data acquired by GMI are used as a reference standard for intercalibrating the passive microwave sensors within the GPM Constellation,
ensuring consistency and accuracy in precipitation estimation across multiple satellite platforms.

.. _gpm_constellation:

GPM Constellation
--------------------

The `GPM Constellation <https://gpm.nasa.gov/missions/GPM/constellation>`_ is composed by satellites from various space agencies, each equipped with microwave radiometers.
These radiometers operate across a range of frequencies, from 6 to 183 GHz, and include both conical-scanning and cross-track-scanning instruments.

Low-frequency channels have been used for rainfall estimation since the launch of the first SSM/I instrument in 1987.
Instead, high-frequency microwave channels which were originally designed for water vapor profiling have proven particularly useful
for discerning precipitation in regions with uncertain land surface emissivities, such as frozen and snow-covered areas.

Over the years, the composition of sensors within the constellation has evolved, leading to changes in spatial coverage and sampling frequency.
These changes are influenced by the number of operational sensors and their respective orbits.

The operational timeline of the GPM constellation is depicted in the figure below.

.. image:: /static/timeline.png
  :alt: GPM Constellation Timeline
  :align: center

It's important to note that not all existing PMW sensors currently in orbit are part of the GPM constellation.
For instance, the constellation does not include 7 Chinese FY-3 Microwave Radiation Imagers (MWRI) and 6 Microwave Humidity Sounders (MWHS),
as well as 5 Russian Imaging/Sounding Microwave Radiometers (MTVZA).

The `WindSat Polarimetric Microwave Radiometer <https://www.eoportal.org/satellite-missions/coriolis#mission-status>`_ is also not part of the constellation.
Furthermore, recent satellite missions such as `TROPICS <https://weather.ndc.nasa.gov/tropics/>`_ and `TEMPEST <https://tempest.colostate.edu/>`_,
as well as private industry sensors from `Tomorrow.io <https://www.tomorrow.io/space/sounder/>`_ and `GEMS <https://weatherstream.com/gems/>`_,
have not yet been integrated into the GPM Constellation.

Additional references to all the PMW sensors can be found in the :ref:`Useful Resources <useful_resources>` section at the end of this document."

The video here below illustrates the precipitation measurements acquired by the GPM constellation sensors over a 3-hour period.

.. _gpm_sensors:

GPM Sensors
-------------

The GPM mission relies on passive and active remote sensing measurements to measure the properties of precipitation.
In the following subsections some theoretical fundamentals of spaceborne radars and passive microwave sensors are introduced.


.. _radars:

Radars
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Spaceborne radars operate by transmitting microwave signals towards the Earth's surface and recording the backscattered portion of the signal.

The time delay between the transmitted and reflected signals determines the distance to the atmospheric volume being sensed, known as the radar gate,
while the strength of the backscattered signals, known as radar reflectivity, is related to the class, size and concentration of the hydrometeors present in that volume.

This capability allows radars to provide insights into the three-dimensional structure of clouds and precipitation.
Because of the direct physical relationship between radar reflectivity and hydrometeor properties,
spaceborne radars are able to generate highly accurate precipitation estimates.

The radar frequency governs the sensitivity, the electromagnetic scattering regime and the degree
to which the radar signals are attenuated within clouds and precipitation.
For instance, detecting cloud droplets and light precipitation requires high microwave frequencies, such as W and Ka bands, respectively.
On the other hand, observing intense precipitation cores necessitates lower frequencies,
like the Ku band, which are less affected by the attenuation caused by high concentrations of large hydrometeors.

The use of spaceborne radar measurements necessitates addressing several critical factors,
including attenuation, surface clutter, minimum detectable signal, and non-uniform beam filling.

**Attenuation**: When radar signals propagate through the atmosphere, they interact with various
atmospheric constituents such as water vapor, clouds, and precipitation particles.
Attenuation refers to the weakening of a radar signal as it moves further away from the emitter and is scattered, reflected,
and absorbed by precipitation and other atmospheric particles.
Correcting for attenuation effects is crucial for accurate precipitation estimation,
as it directly affects the strength of the received radar signal and, consequently, the estimation of hydrometeor properties.

**Surface Clutter**: Surface clutter occurs when radar signals reflect off the Earth's surface,
potentially masking precipitation echoes, particularly in mountainous terrain and within the first 2000 km of the atmosphere.

**Minimum Detectable Signal**: The minimum detectable signal represents the weakest radar signal
that the system can reliably discern above background noise levels.
This threshold is influenced by factors  such as the radar's sensitivity, the system's noise characteristics,
and the presence of interfering signals.
In regions with low signal-to-noise
such as distant or weak precipitation echoes, detecting meaningful radar returns is challenging.

**Non-uniform Beam Filling**: Non-uniform beam filling occurs when the radar beam encounters hydrometeors of varying
sizes and concentrations within its footprint.
As a result, the received radar signal may represent an average of different hydrometeor populations,
leading to uncertainties in estimating precipitation intensity and distribution.

Compared to passive microwave sensors, spaceborne radars, especially those operating at Ku and Ka bands,
are less influenced by atmospheric gases like water vapor and are unaffected by surface microwave emissions.

.. _pmw:

PMW
~~~~

Passive microwave (PMW) sensors lack ranging capabilities like radars, such as determining the distance to precipitation particles.
Instead, they measure upwelling microwave radiation at the top of the atmosphere within their Field Of View (FOV).
This integrated signal depends on various factors including surface temperature and emissivity, as well as the temperature, absorption/emissivity,
and scattering properties of precipitation, clouds, and atmospheric gases.

When interpreting PMW measurements, it's crucial to consider atmospheric conditions (clear-sky vs. non-precipitating clouds and precipitating clouds)
and distinguish between channel types (window vs. absorption bands) and microwave frequency (low vs. high).
Furthermore, lower microwave frequencies correspond to channels with lower spatial resolution,
complicating signal interpretation due to spatial variability within the FOV.

Sensors utilizing window channels are termed "imagers" (e.g., TMI, SSMI, AMSR-E, ASMR2), while those using absorption channels are termed "sounders"
(e.g., MHS, SAPHIR, ATMS). Nowadays, many satellites carry sensors with both imaging and sounding capabilities (e.g., SSMI/S, GMI) to exploit channel synergies.

When selecting microwave frequencies for passive atmospheric sounding, it's necessary to ensure that the chosen frequencies are sensitive enough
to detect the desired atmospheric properties, such as humidity, while also guaranteeing that the signal
can penetrate through the atmosphere to the required altitude without being excessively absorbed or becoming saturated.
This concept of penetration refers to the microwave signal's ability to travel through the atmosphere and reach the satellite sensor
after being emitted by the Earth's surface or atmospheric constituents.

Absorption/sounding channels focus on sensing signals primarily from atmospheric gases, such as water vapor and oxygen,
and measure around their absorption lines.
These lines represent specific frequencies at which atmospheric gases strongly absorb microwave radiation.
For instance, oxygen absorption is significant at frequencies such as 50-60 GHz and 118 GHz,
whereas water vapor absorption is notable at frequencies like 22.235 GHz and 183 GHz.
These channels are particularly useful for profiling atmospheric temperature and humidity, respectively.

The observed brightness temperature (BT) in these channels correlates with the dryness or warmth of the air mass.

On the other hand, window channels predominantly capture signals from the Earth's surface and precipitation.
They are less affected by atmospheric absorption compared to the absorption channels.
Window channels operate across various frequencies, including 6-7 GHz, 10-11 GHz, 18.7 GHz, 23-24 GHz, 31.4 GHz, and 36-37 GHz.

Notably, channels around 89 GHz and 150-165.5 GHz, while still considered "window" channels,
exhibit increased sensitivity to atmospheric conditions, particularly regarding water vapor, cloud water content, and ice particles.

In clear-sky conditions, window channels can directly observe the surface.
In cloudy conditions, they still detect surface signals, but lower frequencies have a better ability to penetrate through the atmosphere,
providing valuable insights into atmospheric conditions even in the presence of clouds.

For clear-sky and non-precipitating clouds, dominant properties include absorption/emission and transmission.
In non-precipitating clouds, with small cloud droplets, scattering is negligible.
However, microwave scattering becomes relevant with frequencies above 50 GHz in the presence of ice particles.

Using sounding sensors to estimate precipitation relies on detecting the scattering signature of ice particles with high-frequency channels,
while imaging sensors exploit low-frequency channels to capture microwave emission from raindrops,
and middle to high frequency channels to capture the scattering signature of ice particles.

In intense precipitating clouds, scattering is the dominant property.
Microwave scattering, known as the microwave depression, occurs due to ice particles reflecting upwelling microwave
radiation back to the surface, thereby reducing the observed brightness temperature from space.
Scattering signatures are highly sensitive to the size distribution, shapes, and densities of ice particles.

Over the ocean, the contrast between cold water surface and warmer raindrops enables the identification of precipitation using low-frequency channels.
However, over land, this contrast is minimal.
Middle and high frequencies (e.g., 89 GHz and 183 GHz) are utilized to detect BT depressions caused by ice particle scattering against the warm land background.

It's important to note that unlike infrared radiation, which is strongly tied with an object's temperature, the emitted microwave radiation
is governed by the object's physical properties (which controls the microwave emissivity).

The figure below displays the BTs sensed by GMI Hurricane Ida's landfall on August 29, 2021, at 15:13:00 UTC.
Please note the BT depression over land in the high frequency channels, and the higher BT in the lower frequency channels over the ocean.

for detailed information on product variables and their attributes.


.. _gpm_products:

GPM Products

In the following subsections the different types of GPM products are presented.


.. _radar_reflectivity:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Radar reflectivity measurements from PR and DPR are available in the L2A products.
Use ``gpm.available_products(category="RADAR", product_levels="2A")`` to list the available products.

.. _pmw_brightness_temperature:

PMW Brightness Temperature
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Brightness temperature measurements from the :ref:`PMW sensors <pmw>` within the :ref:`GPM constellation <gpm_constellation>` are available in the L1B and L1C products.
The L1B product provide the raw brightness temperature measurements, while the L1C product provides the inter-calibrated brightness temperatures.
Use ``gpm.available_products(category="PMW", product_levels="1C")`` to list the available products.

.. _radar_precipitation:

Radar Precipitation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TRMM PR is a Ku-band radar and thus lack the sensitivity to detect drizzle and light precipitation.
The GPM DPR addresses this limitation with an additional Ka-band, offering improved sensitivity to lighter rain and falling snow.

However, radar signals reflected by snowfall and light precipitation often fall below the minimum detectable signal and goes undetected.
Nonetheless, the GPM DPR miss only a small fraction of the total rain volume due to the relatively minor contribution from light rain and snowfall.

Spaceborne radars cannot rely on a simple Z-R relationship for precipitation estimation due to the absence of a global Z-R relationship valid for all precipitation types.
Instead, they utilize complex inversion algorithms to retrieve the hydrometeor distribution within each radar gate,
accounting for factors like signal attenuation and non-uniform beam filling.

The following video nicely illustrates the importance of understanding and accurately predict the hydrometeor size distribution.

Use ``gpm.available_products(category="RADAR", product_levels="2A")`` to list the available products.

**Please note that the intensity of instantanouos precipitation rate estimates is currently capped at 300 mm/hr !**

.. _pmw_precipitation:

PMW Precipitation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A :ref:`PMW sensor <pmw>` measures, at specific frequencies, the outcoming top of the atmosphere (TOA) microwave radiation within the instrument field of view (FOV).
This radiation arises from the natural reflection and emission of the Earth's surface and by its gaseous, liquid, and solid atmospheric constituents.

The signal sensed by PMW sensors is therefore an integrated measure of a complex interplay of processes occurring in the atmospheric column,
which make the precipitation retrievals notoriously difficult.

When the surface emissivity can be estimated accurately (i.e. over the oceans), the difference from the observed TOA microwave
radiation at specific microwave bands can be exploited to obtain a reasonable estimate of the rain rate.
However, over land and ice-covered surfaces where modeling surface emissivity is more challenging,
the uncertainty in the precipitation retrievals increases substantially.
Additionally, over snow-covered terrain, it's very hard to disentangle the scattering
and emission signature of the snow in the air from the signature of snow on the ground.

The Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF) is used to retrieve precipitation estimates from all PMW sensors of the :ref:`GPM constellation <gpm_constellation>`.
GPROF use a Bayesian inversion technique in conjunction with a-priori database to constrain the candidate solutions based on auxiliary
model-based parameters such surface temperature, surface type and total column water vapor.
This a-priori database is build using observed DPR precipitation profiles and their associated brightness temperature signals.

For a comprehensive understanding of the theoretical and mathematical foundations of the GPROF algorithm please
refer to the `GPROF ATBD <https://gpm.nasa.gov/resources/documents/gpm-gprof-algorithm-theoretical-basis-document-atbd>`_.

Precipitation estimates derived from GPM Constellation sensors are available in the L2A products.
Use ``gpm.available_products(category="PMW", product_levels="2A")`` to list the available products.

**Please note that the intensity of instantanouos precipitation rate estimates is currently capped at 80 mm/hr !**


.. _corra_precipitation:

CORRA Precipitation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Combined Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) use TMI/GMI multichannel radiometric measurements as additional integral constraints on PR/DPR retrieval algorithms.
The combined use of coincident active and passive microwave sensor data offers complementary information about the
macro and microphysical processes of precipitating clouds which can be used to reduce the under constrained nature of the inversion problem.
In simple terms, the combined algorithms use the radiometer signal as a constraint on the attenuation seen by the radar or
to counterbalance the lack of sensitivity of the radar to light precipitation.

CORRA produce a set of geophysical parameters, including hydrometeor profiles, particle size distributions, and surface parameters,
that are physically consistent with both radar reflectivity profiles and brightness temperature radiometer measurements over the radar swath.

The TRMM/GPM CORRA product can be accessed with GPM-API using the ``2B-TRMM-CORRA`` and ``2B-GPM-CORRA``  product acronyms.

For the theoretical and mathematical details of the combined radar/radiometer algorithm please
refer to the `CORRA ATBD <https://gpm.nasa.gov/resources/documents/gpm-combined-radar-radiometer-precipitation-algorithm-theoretical-basis>`_.

**Please note that the intensity of CORRA instantanouos precipitation rate estimates is currently capped at 80 mm/hr !**

.. _imerg_precipitation:

IMERG Precipitation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) is an advanced algorithm designed
to generate a high resolution precipitation product every 30 minutes, covering the full globe (up to version 6,  a quasi-global area from 60°S to 60°N)
with a spatial resolution of 0.1° x 0.1°.

By leveraging measurements from Geostationary (GEO) IR imagers and the :ref:`GPM PMW sensors constellation <gpm_constellation>`,
IMERG provides a "best-estimate" of 30-minute average precipitation rates.

IMERG generates three distinct precipitation products.
The *IMERG Early* (``IMERG-ER``) product  is available 4 hours after real-time, followed by *IMERG Late* (``IMERG-LR``) after 14 hours.
The final product version, *IMERG Final* (``IMERG-FR``), is released approximately 3.5 months later.

The 4-hour and 14-hour delays for Early and Late products are necessary to gather and process satellite measurements from various space agencies.
The 3.5-month delay for the Final product enables the incorporation of rain gauge data from the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC)
and the application of bias correction to refine the satellite-based precipitation estimates.

In the design of IMERG, a significant challenge is the scarcity of direct measurements from the GPM constellation in most grid cells within any 30-minute period.
To fill these spatial and temporal gaps left by PMW satellites, IMERG exploits storm system motion vectors and precipitation estimates derived from GEO IR measurements.

Storm system motion vectors enables the backward and forward propagation, or "morphing," of available PMW-derived precipitation measurements across the grid.
While IMERG Early uses only forward propagation in time (extrapolation in time), IMERG Late benefits form from both forward and backward propagation (interpolation in time).

When PMW data are too sparse, IMERG incorporates precipitation estimates derived from GEO IR imagery through a weighted Kalman filter.

IR-based precipitation estimates are derived from the
`Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Merged 4-km Global IR data product <https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/GPM_MERGIR_1/summary>`_.
This dataset composites infrared (IR) brightness temperature measurements from numerous geostationary sensors over their operational periods,
including European (METEOSAT-5/7/8/9/10/11), Japanese (GMS-5, MTSat-1R/2, Himawari-8/9), and U.S. (GOES-8/9/10/11/12/13/14/15/16/17/18) satellites,
every 30 minutes between 60°N/S.

IR-based precipitation estimates are obtained using the `PERSIANN-CSS algorithm <https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/apme/43/12/jam2173.1.xml>`_ (up to IMERG V6) and
the `PDIR-NOW algorithm <https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/hydr/21/12/jhm-d-20-0177.1.xml>`_ (IMERG V7).
However, these estimates have lower accuracy compared to PMW measurement due to the indirect relationship between infrared cloud top temperature (sensed by the IR imagers)
and surface precipitation.

It's worth noting that the source of storm system motion vectors has evolved across different IMERG versions:
V5 derived motion vectors from the sequence of GEO IR imagery,
V6 transitioned to using NWP/reanalysis-based total precipitable water vapor (TPWWV) fields,
and V7 employs a combination of NWP/reanalysis-based precipitation, total precipitable liquid water (TPLW) and TPWWV.

For more information on IMERG, including theoretical and algorithmic details, please refer to the ATBD of
`IMERG version 6 <https://gpm.nasa.gov/resources/documents/algorithm-information/IMERG-V06-ATBD>`_ and
`IMERG version 7 <https://gpm.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-07/IMERG_V07_ATBD_final_230712.pdf>`_.

Latent Heating
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Latent heating refers to the release or absorption of heat energy during phase changes of water within the Earth's atmosphere.

When water vapor condenses into liquid droplets or solid ice crystals, as in the formation of clouds and precipitation,
it releases latent heat into the surrounding atmosphere.
This latent heat, often referred to as "latent heat of condensation" is a primary driver of large- and small-scale atmospheric circulations.
Conversely, when liquid water evaporates into vapor, or solid ice melt to liquid water or sublimates directly into vapor,
heat energy is absorbed from the surrounding environment. This absorption of latent heat is an essential component
of the water cycle and contributes to the redistribution of energy within the atmosphere.

Estimates of the heat released or absorbed at various altitudes are crucial to improve global atmospheric circulation models
and can also be assimilated operationally into numerical weather forecasts to constrain the initial conditions of the models.

Two algorithms, the `Goddard Convective-Stratiform Heating (CSH) <https://gpm.nasa.gov/resources/documents/goddard-convective-stratiform-heating-csh-algorithm>`_ and the
`Japanese Spectral Latent Heating (SLH) <https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/GPM/doc/algorithm/TRMGPM_SLH_V07A_ATBD.pdf>`_,
are employed for retrieving latent heating estimates from TRMM/GPM measurements.
The SLH algorithm requires only radar data, while CSH make use of the joint PR/TMI and DPR/GMI measurements.

Both algorithms are built upon pre-computed look-up tables derived from simulations from cloud-resolving models (CRMs)
such as the `Goddard Cumulus Ensemble model (GCE) <https://earth.gsfc.nasa.gov/meso/models/gce>`_ and regional-scale models like the
`NASA Unified Weather Research and Forecasting model (NU-WRF) <https://earth.gsfc.nasa.gov/meso/models/nu-wrf>`_ and
the `Japan Meteorological Agency's Local Forecast Model (LFM) <https://www.jma.go.jp/jma/en/Activities/nwp.html>`_.

The TRMM/GPM SLH and CSH products can be accessed with GPM-API using the ``2A-TRMM-SLH``, ``2B-TRMM-CSH``, ``2A-GPM-SLH``, ``2B-GPM-CSH`` product acronyms.

For a recent overview of CSH and SLH products,
please refer to `Tao et al., 2022 <https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jmsj/100/2/100_2022-015/_html/-char/en>`_ and
`Shige et al., 2009 <https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/22/20/2009jcli2919.1.xml>`_ respectively.



.. _coincidence_datasets:

Coincidence Datasets
------------------------

In the following subsections some of the coincidence satellite datasets available within the TRMM and GPM era are presented.
None of the following datasets is currently supported by GPM-API but we welcome contributions to expand the software capabilities.

AMSR-E - CloudSat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `A-Train Constellation <https://atrain.nasa.gov/>`_ is a group of satellites
(including `Aqua <https://aqua.nasa.gov/>`_,
`CloudSat <https://cloudsat.atmos.colostate.edu/>`_,
`CALIPSO <https://www-calipso.larc.nasa.gov/>`_, and
`Aura <https://aura.gsfc.nasa.gov/>`_) that closely followed one another along the same orbital track.

This allowed near-simultaneous observations from a wide variety of instruments that can be
synergistically used to further our understanding of the Earth's atmosphere and surface.

The A-Train Constellation between 2006 and 2011 provided the quasi-simulaneous acquisitions of the
94-GHz (W-band) `CloudSat Profiling Radar (CPR) <https://www.cloudsat.cira.colostate.edu/>`_
and the 12-channel (6.925 - 89 GHz) Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E).

The `ASMR2-AUX <https://www.cloudsat.cira.colostate.edu/data-products/amsr2-aux>`_ dataset contains a subset
of ancillary AMSR2 surface precipitation and ocean products data collocated with each CPR footprints, while
the `AMSRERR_CPR_002 <https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/AMSRERR_CPR_002/summary>`_ dataset provides only the AMSR-E derived rain rate.

The AMSR-E - CloudSat dataset is particularly useful for developing and validating PMW-based precipitation retrieval algorithms
using CloudSat CPR data as a reference.


GPM - CloudSat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The TRMM/GPM-CloudSat Coincidence dataset collects satellite acquisitions (intersections) occurring
within a small time window between the TRMM/GPM-CO satellites and the 94-GHz (W-band) CloudSat Profiling Radar (CPR).

These coincidences yield combined dual/triple-frequency radar profiles, incluuding W-band from CPR and:

-  the GPM DPR Ku/Ka-band reflectivites along with the brightness temperatures from the 13-channel (10-183 GHz) GMI radiometer.
-  the TRMM PR Ku-band reflecitvity along with the brightness temperatures from the 9-channel (10-89 GHz) TMI radiometer.

Additionally, the dataset also includes collocated thermal and near-infrared measurements from the
`Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) <https://aqua.nasa.gov/modis>`_ imager
onboard the Aqua satellite (channels 20 and 27-36).

This dataset serves various scientific purposes, including algorithm evaluation and development, identification of deficiencies,
studies on snow and light rain sensitivity, exploration of cloud processes, radiative transfer simulations, and
examination of land surface effects on radar, radiometer, or combined-sensor precipitation retrieval algorithms.

For detailed information on the TRMM/GPM-CloudSat Coincidence dataset, please
refer to the corresponding `journal article <https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/12/2264>`_
and the `Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) <https://gpm.nasa.gov/resources/documents/cloudsat-gpm-coincidence-dataset-version-1c>`_.

The coincidence dataset can be downloaded with GPM-API using the ``2B-GPM-CSAT`` and ``2B-TRMM-CSAT`` product acronyms.
